Revision history for Perl extension Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate.

First release


0.02  Wed Nov 01 2006

Fixed bug in Perl with the q' ' construct.

Fixed bug in Template where testDetectSpaces would include a newline.

Moved all highlighting Methods from Kate to Template, so plugins can now function 
standalone.

Fixed reset, it did not work properly if Kate was screwed up by bugs, now it does.

Updated documentation.

Fixed startup penalty for Kate. Kate does not load all plugins at atartup, but 
searches for them programmatically.

Rewrote testing, Windows OS should now be able to cope with the length of the 
test-harness commandline.

Optimized testmethods in Template, gained some speed.
