<h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
<p>Box is an object oriented language developed to make graphics
as easy as possible. Box is in its early stage of development,
but it already provides most of the features needed
to create quality pictures and figures.
Box has many advantages over traditional GUI graphics editors:
<ul class="simple">
<li>Reusability: you can draw things inside a Window; you can
then translate, rotate, scale and put it inside another Window;</li>
<li>Transformation matrices can be calculated automatically
from constraints given by the user;</li>
<li>Flexible syntax: the philosophy is "don't complain if something
is missing, use default values!".
You can specify many parameters, but you don't have to!</li>
<li>Even more flexible syntax: if p is a list of points
then p.Get[3] gives the third point, p.Get[3.5] gives a point
between the third and the fourth and p.Get[(3.5, 1)]...
look at the documentation ;-)
</li>

<li>You can even draw fractal pictures;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Box has also the following features:
<ul class="simple">
<li>Translucency: the alpha channel of colors can be set to draw
partially transparent objects;</li>
<li>Radial and linear color gradients can be set very easily,
specifying even more than two colors;</li>
<li>Supported output formats are Postscript (EPS), PDF, SVG, PNG.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 class="title">Examples</h1>
<p>The documentation of Box is still under construction.
However you may find some examples inside the tarball (examples directory).
Some of them can be browsed <a href="examples/index.html">here</a>.
Box can be used also to create simple animations,
here are some examples:</p>

<center>
<table> <tbody>
<tr>
<td><form><input type="button" value="NEXT" onclick="change()"></form></td>
<td><img name="anim0" src="bouncing.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim1" src="shy_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim2" src="washing_machine_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim3" src="losing_eyes_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim4" src="machine_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
</tr>
</center>

</tbody> </table>
