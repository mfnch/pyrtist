Introduction
------------

Box is a programming language developed to make graphics easy.
Everything you draw (lines, circles, text, polygons, etc.)
is done inside ``Windows``.
``Windows`` object are the target of graphic commands and
can be translated, scaled, rotated and used
inside other ``Windows``.
This is actually simpler than what it may seem!
Indeed, you can define hot points for each ``Window`` you
create. These hot points can be used to express
how to rotate, translate and scale your figures,
removing the necessity of calculating rotation angles,
scale factors, etc. Everything is calculated automatically
and when you change your figure the transformations
are adjusted accordingly, so that everything is placed
where it should.
