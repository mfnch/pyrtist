<h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
<p>Box is a programming language developed to make graphics easy.
Everything you draw (lines, circles, text, polygons, etc.)
is done inside "Window"s.
Window objects are the target of graphic commands and
can be translated, scaled, rotated and used
inside other Windows.
This is actually simpler than what it may seem!
Indeed, you can define hot points for each Window you
create. These hot points can be used to express
how to rotate, translate and scale your figures,
removing the necessity of calculating rotation angles,
scale factors, etc. Everything is calculated automatically
and when you change your figure the transformations
are adjusted accordingly, so that everything is placed
where it should.
</p>

<h1 class="title">Examples</h1>
<p>The documentation of Box is still under construction.
However you may find some examples inside the tarball (examples directory).
Some of them can be browsed <a href="examples/index.html">here</a>.
Box can be used also to create simple animations,
here are some examples:</p>

<center>
<table> <tbody>
<tr>
<td><form><input type="button" value="NEXT" onclick="change()"></form></td>
<td><img name="anim0" src="bouncing.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim1" src="shy_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim2" src="washing_machine_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim3" src="losing_eyes_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
<td><img name="anim4" src="machine_0.gif" border="0" hspace=10></td>
</tr>
</center>

</tbody> </table>
