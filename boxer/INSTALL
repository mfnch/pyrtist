INSTALLATION
============

These are the instruction to compiler Boxer on your Unix (Linux/Mac) machine.
If you want to use Boxer on Windows, just download the all in one package
containing both Box and Boxer. You can find it on the sourceforge website:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc/

FIRST LET'S INSTALL BOX
-----------------------

Boxer is the graphical user interface for Box, you'll then need to install Box
to be able to use Boxer. You can download Box from the aforementioned web 
address.

Once you have installed Box, check that it can be executed regularly from
your shell by simply typing 'box'. You should see something like:

  me@my-machine:~$ box
  Error: You should specify an input file!
  Try 'box -h' to get some help!

where 'me@my-machine:~$' is the prompt displayed by your shell.
If you get:

  me@my-machine:~$ box
  bash: box: command not found

then probably you'll need to adjust your PATH environmental variable and add
the directory containing the box executable. For example:

  me@my-machine:~$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
  me@my-machine:~$ box
  Error: You should specify an input file!
  Try 'box -h' to get some help!

Here Box was configured with './configure --prefix=/usr/local' and hence the Box
executable was installed inside /usr/local/bin.

LET'S INSTALL BOXER NOW
-----------------------

To install Boxer:

- make sure PyGTK is installed on the Python interpreter you want to use

- run 'python setup.py install' as a system administrator. For example,

    sudo python setup.py install

  where ``python'' is the Python interpreter you want to use.

- you should then be able to launch Boxer with

    boxer

  or

    boxer program.box

  where ``program.box'' is a Box program saved using Boxer.
  Boxer will use the Box executable which is invoked by your shell when
  you simply type 'box'.
