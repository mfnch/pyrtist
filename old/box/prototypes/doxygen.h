 * @brief Example showing how to document a function with Doxygen.
 *
 * Description of what the function does. This part may refer to the parameters
 * of the function, like @p param1 or @p param2. A word of code can also be
 * inserted like @c this which is equivalent to <tt>this</tt> and can be useful
 * to say that the function returns a @c void or an @c int. If you want to have
 * more than one word in typewriter font, then just use @<tt@>.
 * We can also include text verbatim,
 * @verbatim like this@endverbatim
 * Sometimes it is also convenient to include an example of usage:
 * @code
 * BoxStruct *out = Box_The_Function_Name(param1, param2);
 * printf("something...\n");
 * @endcode
 * Or,
 * @code{.py}
 * pyval = python_func(arg1, arg2)
 * print pyval
 * @endcode
 * when the language is not the one used in the current source file (but
 * <b>be careful</b> as this may be supported only by recent versions
 * of Doxygen). By the way, <b>this is how you write bold text</b> or,
 * if it is just one word, then you can just do @b this.
 * @param param1 Description of the first parameter of the function.
 * @param param2 The second one, which follows @p param1.
 * @return Describe what the function returns.
 * @see Box_The_Second_Function
 * @see Box_The_Last_One
 * @see http://website/
 * @note Something to note.
 * @warning Warning.

 * For functions, automatic links are generated when the parenthesis () follow
