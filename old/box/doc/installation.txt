Installation
============

There are currently three methods for installing Box:

- `Installation from sources`_: can be done easily on Unix platforms
  (Linux, Mac OS) and somewhat less easily on Microsoft Windows platforms;
- `Installation on Ubuntu Linux`_: can be done easily downloading the
  deb package and using ``dpkg -i``;
- `Installation on Windows`_: just a matter of downloading a zip
  archive. The executable can be used immediately after unzipping
  the archive.

Installation from sources
-------------------------
Download the tarball from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box-0.1.tar.gz``.
Then untar and configure the package with::

  tar xzvf box-0.1.tar.gz
  cd box-0.1
  ./configure --prefix=/usr

``configure`` outputs a summary at the end. Be sure it looks like that::

  Configuration summary:
  ----------------------
  Support for the Cairo 2D graphic library: yes

If you get a ``"no"`` then check that the Cairo graphics library
`<http://www.cairographics.org>`__ is installed on your system
together with the development files.
On Ubuntu and Debian derivatives, you can install it with::

  sudo aptitude install libcairo libcairo-dev

You should enter the root password when necessary
for the installation to proceed.
If you were required to install Cairo, then reconfigure the package
with ``./configure --prefix=/usr``.
You can then proceed to the compilation with::

  make

If the compilation is succesful::

  sudo make install

The Box executable, libraries and headers will be installed
on your system. You can take a look at the man page with::

  man box

Further help and hints with the installation can be found
on the ``README`` and ``INSTALL`` files inside the package.

The manual is online at `<http://boxc.sourceforge.net>`__.
If you need further help, take a look at the examples.

Note for installation on Mac OS
-------------------------------

If you compiled Box from source on Mac OS and you experience problems when
loading libraries (``-l g`` seems not to work as it should), try to
reconfigure Box with the additional option ``--with-included-ltdl``,
such as::

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-included-ltdl

and then compile it again. This should force the use of the provided
ltdl (libtool) library and should fix the bug.

Installation on Ubuntu Linux
----------------------------

Download the Ubuntu package from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box_0.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb``.
Install it with::

  sudo dpkg -i box_0.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb

Enter the root password when necessary.
You may have to install ``libcairo`` with::

  sudo aptitude install libcairo

This is often not necessary, as ``Cairo`` is usually preinstalled
on an average Ubuntu distribution.

The manual is online at `<http://boxc.sourceforge.net>`__.
If you need further help, take a look at the examples.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Download the zip file from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box20080727.zip``.
Unzip it inside the directory which is more convenient for your needs.
You'll find the Box executable in ``box20080727\bin\box.exe`` and some
examples inside ``box20080727\examples``.
Make a check as follows: open the MS-DOS prompt and enter
the examples directory::

  cd box20080727\examples
  ..\bin\box.exe translucency.box -l g

You can then view the produced output file ``translucency.png``
with your favourite image viewer.
As an alternative, to run a Box source file, you can just right click
on the file icon and select "Open with...".
Then browse the directory where you unzipped the binaries:
select the file box-lg.bat under the directory ``box20080727\bin``
which was created when unzipping the Box binaries
(box-lg.bat is equivalent to ``box.exe -l g``).
Proceed and open the file (tick on "Remember application" if you
want Windows to use Box automatically when double clicking on Box
sources). The file should be executed immediately
and the output images should be generated, if any.

Remember that the directory ``box20080727`` can be moved to another location,
this won't affect the functionality of Box.
However you have to move the whole directory, preserving
its structure: the box executable searches for libraries and headers
in the directory ``DIR\..\lib\box``, where DIR is the directory
which contains the executable ``box.exe``.
