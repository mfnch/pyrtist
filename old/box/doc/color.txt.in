Color instruction
-----------------

The ``Color`` instruction can be used to create colors.
It is a structure composed by four real numbers
``(Real r, g, b, a)``.
The members ``r``, ``g`` and ``b`` correspond respectively
to the red, green and blue components of the color,
while the ``a`` member is the alpha channel and can be used
to define translucent (transparent) colors.
These real number can be set to values which range from 0.0 to 1.0,
corresponding respectively to lowest and highest intensity.
When the alpha channel is set to 0 the color is fully transparent
when set to 1 the color is fully opaque.
A new color can be defined using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: Box

  color = Color[.r=0.1, .g=0.2, .b=0.3, .a=0.4]

Colors can be defined starting from existing colors:

.. code-block:: Box

  //{def}

The header file ``"g"`` defines a structure
which contains some predefined colors:

.. code-block:: Box

  color = (Color black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
           dark_red, dark_green, dark_yellow, dark_blue, dark_magenta
           dark_cyan, grey, none)

You can set the current color in drawing instructions such as
``Poly``, ``Circle``, etc.

.. code-block:: Box

  \ w.Poly[..., color, ...]

or directly inside an opened window:

.. code-block:: Box

  w = Window[][ ..., color, ...]
