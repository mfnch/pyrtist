INSTALLATION
============

These are the instruction to compile Pyrtist on your Unix (Linux/Mac) machine.

- make sure PyGTK is installed on the Python interpreter you want to use

- run 'python setup.py install' as a system administrator. For example,

    sudo python setup.py install

  where ``python'' is the Python interpreter you want to use.

- you should then be able to launch Pyrtist with

    pyrtist

  or

    pyrtist program.py

  where ``program.py'' is a Pyrtist program saved using Pyrtist.
