Installation
============

There are currently three methods for installing Box:

- `Installation from sources`_: can be done easily on Unix platforms
  (Linux, Mac OS) and somewhat less easily on Microsoft Windows platforms;
- `Installation on Ubuntu Linux`_: can be done easily downloading the
  deb package and using ``dpkg -i``;
- `Installation on Windows`_: just a matter of downloading a zip
  archive. The executable can be used immediately after unzipping
  the archive.

Installation from sources
-------------------------
Download the tarball from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box-0.1.tar.gz``.
Then untar and configure the package with::

  tar xzvf box-0.1.tar.gz
  ./configure --prefix=/usr

``configure`` outputs a summary at the end. Be sure it looks like that::

  Configuration summary:
  ----------------------
  Support for the Cairo 2D graphic library: yes

If you get a ``"no"`` then check that the Cairo graphics library
`<http://www.cairographics.org>`__ is installed on your system
together with the development files.
On Ubuntu and Debian derivatives, you can install it with::

  sudo aptitude install libcairo libcairo-dev

You should enter the root password when necessary
for the installation to proceed.
If you were required to install Cairo, then reconfigure the package
with ``./configure --prefix=/usr``.
You can then proceed to the compilation with::

  make

If the compilation is succesful::

  sudo make install

The Box executable, libraries and headers will be installed
on your system. You can take a look at the man page with::

  man box

Further help and hints with the installation can be found
on the ``README`` and ``INSTALL`` files inside the package.

The manual is online at `<http://boxc.sourceforge.net>`__.
If you need further help, take a look at the examples.

Installation on Ubuntu Linux
----------------------------

Download the Ubuntu package from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box_0.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb``.
Install it with::

  sudo dpkg -i box_0.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb

Enter the root password when necessary.
You may have to install ``libcairo`` with::

  sudo aptitude install libcairo

This is often not necessary, as ``Cairo`` is usually preinstalled
on an average Ubuntu distribution.

The manual is online at `<http://boxc.sourceforge.net>`__.
If you need further help, take a look at the examples.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

Download the zip file from `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/boxc>`__.
This is usually a file with name such as ``box20080727.zip``.
Unzip it inside the directory which is more convenient for your needs.
You'll find the Box executable in ``box20080727\bin\box.exe`` and some
examples inside ``box20080727\examples``.
Make a check as follows: open the MS-DOS prompt and enter
the examples directory::

  cd box20080727\examples
  ..\bin\box.exe translucency.box -l g

You can then view the produced output file ``translucency.png``
with your favourite image viewer.
You can move the entire directory ``box20080727`` to another location,
this won't affect the functionality of Box.
However you have to move the whole directory, preserving
its structure: the box executable searches for libraries and headers
in the directory ``DIR\..\lib\box``, where DIR is the directory
which contains the executable ``box.exe``.
