Window.Line
-----------

The ``Line`` instruction can be used to lines width variable width.
It takes a list of points with optional line width:

.. code-block:: Box

  point_list = window.Line[point1, initial_width1, final_width1
                           point2, initial_width2, final_width2
                           ...]

The widths are real numbers and are used to specify what the line widths
are when entering and exiting each point of the line.
``initial_width`` is the width when exiting from ``point1``, while
``final_width1`` is the width when entering ``point2``.
You can omit them, if you want to draw a line with constant width.

The line in the following picture,

.. image:: line1.png
   :align: center

was obtained using:

.. code-block:: Box

  \ w.Line[p1, 3, 10, p2, 15, 2, p3]

The ``Window.Line`` instruction does also accept ``Color`` and ``Style``
objects to set the color and the filling/border style of the line.
It does also accept ``LineStyle`` objects, which are used to control
how the smoothing is done.

.. image:: line2.png
   :align: center

The lines in the image above were obtained using:

.. code-block:: Box

  \ w.Line[LineStyle[x], p1, 3, 10, p2, 15, 2, p3]

For x = -1, 0, 1 and 2.
