Poly instruction
----------------

The ``Poly`` instruction can be used to draw polygons.
It takes a list of points with optional left and right margins:

.. code-block:: Box

  point_list = Poly[left_margin0, right_margin0, point1,
                    left_margin1, right_margin1, point2,
                    left_margin1, right_margin1, point3, ...]

Left and right margins are real numbers and are used
for rounding the corners. They can be omitted to draw a polygon
with sharp corners. For example:

.. code-block:: Box

  blue = Color[color.blue, .a=0.7]
  pl = Poly[color, a, b, c, d]

draws a polygon with four sides with vertices ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` and ``d``.
``color`` is a ``Color`` object derived from the standard ``color.blue``
color, with modified alpha channel (``.a=0.7``, it is a transparent color!).
The ``Poly`` instruction returns a ``PointList`` object containing
the vertices of the polygon. This pointlist can be used in many ways.
