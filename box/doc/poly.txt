Window.Poly instruction
-----------------------

The ``Poly`` method can be used to draw polygons.
It takes a list of points with optional left and right margins:

.. code-block:: Box

  point_list = window.Poly[left_margin0, right_margin0, point1,
                           left_margin1, right_margin1, point2,
                           left_margin1, right_margin1, point3, ...]

Left and right margins are real numbers and are used
for rounding the corners. They can be omitted to draw polygons
with sharp corners. For instance:

.. code-block:: Box

  pl = w.Poly[color.blue, a, b, c, d]

draws a polygon with vertices ``a``, ``b``, ``c`` and ``d``.
This is the produced output:

.. image:: poly1.png
   :align: center

The ``Poly`` instruction returns a ``PointList`` object containing
the vertices of the polygon. This ``PointList`` can be used in many ways.
One can, for example, draw the polygon which connects the mid-points
of the original polygon sides.

.. code-block:: Box

  i = 1, \ w.Poly[color.yellow, pl.Get[i+0.5], For[++i < 5]]
  \ w.Circle[Color[color.red, .a=0.5], 1, pl]

The second line here draws transparent red circles with radius 1
and center on the points of the ``PointList`` ``pl``.
Note that here we use ``\`` to ignore the ``PointList`` expression
generated by the ``Poly`` method invocation.
This is the result:

.. image:: poly2.png
   :align: center

Now we focus on margins and how the polygon corners can be rounded.


.. image:: ../poly.png
   :align: center

Here is the Box code used to generate all the pictures in this subsection:
