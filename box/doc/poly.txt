Poly instruction
----------------

The ``Poly`` instruction can be used to draw polygons.
It takes a list of points with optional left and right margins:

.. code-block:: Box

  // IN: point1, point2, ... = Point
  // IN(OPTIONAL): left_margin0, right_margin0, ... = Real
  // RETURNS: point_list = PointList
  point_list = Poly[left_margin0, right_margin0, point1,
                    left_margin1, right_margin1, point2,
                    left_margin1, right_margin1, point3, ...]

Left and right margins are just real numbers and are used
for rounding the corners.
