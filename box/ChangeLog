Change log (recent come first)

26 May 2008: Work on the documentation and on the internal allocation system.
  * Started to write documentation on the graphic capabilities of Box.
  * Destructors are now called automatically by the VM before deallocation
    of objects: Window, PointList and Style are now fully deallocated.

17 May 2008: Integration of Cairo in the graphic library.
  * The graphic terminal has been adjusted, removing the lowfn midfn
    function list, which are now replaced by full declared methods.
  * A new function to open any type of windows has been introduced.
    This function takes a GrpWindowPlan which can contain the window
    size, file_name, resolution, etc.
  * Cairo is now detected in configuration scripts and new terminals
    are avaiblable when Box is compiled with support for it.
    We now can use Cairo image, PDF, SVG, PS terminals.
  * Extended the method Window.Save, which now looks at the extension
    and can accordingly save EPS, PNG, PDF, SVG, BMP files.
  * Colors have now an alpha channel: translucency is possible with
    Cairo windows!
  * We can now set the drawing Style: we can decide what rule to use
    for filling and we now can also clip along the path generated
    by all the graphic commands (Line, Circle, Poly and Text).

  * Subtypes are resolved into their children if the method in Subtype.Method
    is not found.
