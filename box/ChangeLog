Change log (recent come first)

27 july 2008: Improved Save method. Compile under Windows 
  * Can define "incomplete windows": windows which throw an error
    whenever they are used. Creation of such windows, however,
    does not produce any errors: this concept is useful for the 
    new syntax of the Window.Save method;
  * Extended the syntax of the Window.Save method: it can now take
    a window and (1) complete it (if it is uncomplete) or (2) put
    the figure into it (if it is complete). In both cases the figure
    fits the destination window;
  * Created man page and Ubuntu package;
  * Ported the source to Windows: we now compile on XP and can
    distribute the first version of Box for Windows;

5 July 2008: Bugfixes in the transformation of draw styles and font

28 June 2008: Filling with linear/radial color gradients (Gradient[]) 
  * Can now express color in HSV (besides RGB) and convert RGB<-->HSV.
  * Can now fill objects using linear or radial color gradients
    (Gradient[] can be used for the purpose).
  * Color[] defines .r=.g=.b=0 and .a=1 by default. Opaque red can be
    defined with Color[.r=1]. Similar behaviour for HSV[].
    They also both accept a triple (for opaque colors) or quadruple
    of reals (for translucent colors).

21 June 2008: Style object now allow tracing borders
  * We can now draw polygons with border, controlling the join style
    (including the miter limit), the cap style, the dashes, the color.
  * Style can be instructed to draw empty polygons. In that case
    the border is not closed in Poly, unless Poly.Close[] is used.

29 May 2008: Work on the documentation and on the internal allocation system.
  * Started to write documentation on the graphic capabilities of Box.
  * Destructors are now called automatically by the VM before deallocation
    of objects: Window, PointList and Style are now fully deallocated.
  * Used Valgrind to track allocation errors: found one major problem
    and corrected other two minor ones. Need to work more on this.

17 May 2008: Integration of Cairo in the graphic library.
  * The graphic terminal has been adjusted, removing the lowfn midfn
    function list, which are now replaced by full declared methods.
  * A new function to open any type of windows has been introduced.
    This function takes a GrpWindowPlan which can contain the window
    size, file_name, resolution, etc.
  * Cairo is now detected in configuration scripts and new terminals
    are avaiblable when Box is compiled with support for it.
    We now can use Cairo image, PDF, SVG, PS terminals.
  * Extended the method Window.Save, which now looks at the extension
    and can accordingly save EPS, PNG, PDF, SVG, BMP files.
  * Colors have now an alpha channel: translucency is possible with
    Cairo windows!
  * We can now set the drawing Style: we can decide what rule to use
    for filling and we now can also clip along the path generated
    by all the graphic commands (Line, Circle, Poly and Text).

26 April 2008: Improvements and bugfixes.
  * Subtypes are resolved into their children if the method in Subtype.Method
    is not found.
  * Bugfix in the resolution of subtype-->parent.

20 April 2008: Adjustments and bugfixes.
  * Bugfix on the strnlen implementation. Should affect only a limited
    number of architectures.
  * Introducing reference counting for objects allocated by the VM:
    still not used to the full extent.
  * Several improvements to Window.Line: it should now be more robust,
    and supports lines having multiple join styles.
  * Poly accepts now (;)
  * Error messages are now displayed when undefined items appear
    inside structures.

30 March 2008: bugfixes and improvements.
  * fixed the VM bug for jump instruction on 64 bit machines.
  * improved the handling of open procedures

22 March 2008: minor improvements, added examples.
  * added builtin functions Max, Min, Abs, Vec.
  * added more examples in the examples directory.
  * Color@Window sets now the current fg color.

20 March 2008: first release of the tarball. Still very unstable.
  First tarball is released, just for letting people try the package.
