STYLE OF THE CODE (10/03/2006):
  Unfortunatly the style is not omogeneousn throughout the program!!!
  This problems is connected with the long life of this code and with my mind
  which changes with experience.
  Better to write down here some conventions:

  InThisWay   --> types
  in_this_way --> instances
  IN_THIS_WAY --> macros
  a, b, c, .. --> local instances (counters, and other instances)
  In_This_Way --> functions

  Tab length = 2, example:

  while( 1 ) {
    printf("Nothing to print!\n");
    printf("Really nothing!\n");
  }

FUNCTIONS: HOW WE DEAL WITH ERRORS....
  This typedef is defined inside 'types.h' which is included in almost every
  source file of the program:

    typedef enum {Failed, Success} Task;

  This is how we define many functions:

    /* This functions deals with a particular task and can exit with
     * or without errors
     */
    Task Do_Do_Do(...)
    {
        ...
        if (...) return Failed;   /* Exits in case of errors! */
        ...
        return Success;           /* Operation succesfully completed! */
    }

  Now we call this function, testing for errors:

    /* Main function */
    int main(void)
    {
        if IS_FAILED(Do_Do_Do(...))
            fprintf(stderr, "Error!\n");
    }
