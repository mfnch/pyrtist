Installation
------------
To compile the sources and install on your machine you may proceed
with the quite usual sequence:

  ./configure --with-cairo
  make
  make install

Detailed installation instructions are available inside the file INSTALL
in this same directory. The '--with-cairo' flag enables detection and
usage of the Cairo 2D graphic library. Be sure to have this library
installed on your system: this is not mandatory, but will give you some
more features (see later section).
If you want a local installation, you may proceed as follows:

  ./configure --prefix=/home/yourusername/local --with-cairo
  make
  make install

Your system won't know where to find the Box executable.
Therefore you may put a line such as

  export PATH=$PATH:~/local/bin

at the end of your bashrc file (which is a hidden file in your home
directory: ~/.bashrc). This last modification is not needed. It just
makes life easier.

Test
----
After installation, you may run some tests to see if the compilation
suceeded. Just type:

  make check

You should get a final message such as:

  0 errors found.
  All tests performed led to success.
  ...

Cairo library
-------------
You can now compile Box with support for the Cairo 2D graphic library.
Cairo gives support for some more output terminals (PDF, SVG, PNG, PS)
and is going to be well exploited in the next Box releases, giving it
many cool features. Be sure to compile Box with the '--with-cairo' flag ;-)

Documentation
-------------
You may find the documentation on the website http://boxc.sourceforge.net/
The documentation is still incomplete. You may start to learn by looking
at the examples on the examples directory.
If you need help or found some bugs, just use the Sourceforge support request.
