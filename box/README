Installation
------------
To compile the sources and install on your machine you may proceed
with the quite usual sequence:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Detailed instructions are available inside the file INSTALL in this same
directory. If you want a local installation, you may proceed as follows:

  ./configure --prefix=/home/yourusername/local
  make
  make install

Your system won't know where to find the Box executable.
Therefore you may put a line such as

  export PATH=$PATH:~/local/bin

at the end of your bashrc file (which is a hidden file in your home
directory: ~/.bashrc). This last modification is not needed. It just
makes life easier.

Test
----
After installation, you may run some tests to see if the compilation
suceeded. Just type:

  make check

You should get a final message such as:

  0 errors found.
  All tests performed led to success.
  ...

Documentation
-------------
You may find the documentation on the website http://boxc.sourceforge.net/
The documentation is still incomplete. You may start to learn by looking
at the examples on the examples directory.
If you need help or found some bugs, just use the Sourceforge support request.
